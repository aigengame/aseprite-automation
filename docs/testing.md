# Test suite

SPA organizes tests first by the behavior owner and then names each test file by its
verification tier. The layout does not mirror source packages or CLI Command Groups.

## Ownership areas

| Directory | Behavior owner |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/application/` | Application orchestration, including compatibility checks before Operation execution. |
| `tests/cli/` | Access Projection through the installed CLI and its in-process projections. |
| `tests/contracts/` | Shared Published Language rules, including Failure Code registration and Operation Descriptor constraints. |
| `tests/export/` | Image Export contract, PNG Artifact verification and publication, and real Aseprite output evidence. |
| `tests/paint/` | Paint Domain Module contract, bounded mutation evidence, and native Pixel Patch behavior. |
| `tests/plan/` | Static Plan preflight, single-Sprite Step composition, and commit gates. |
| `tests/release/` | Release metadata and publication gates. |
| `tests/runtime/` | Aseprite Runtime Integration, including discovery, launch, private Kernel transport, and real-runtime evidence. |
| `tests/sprite/` | Sprite Domain Module contracts plus real creation, persisted reopen, structural inspection, and Target Commit evidence. |

Add an ownership directory only when tests for that behavior exist. Keep a helper in
the narrowest ownership directory that uses it. Move a helper to `tests/support.py`
only when more than one ownership area needs it. Each directory is a Python package,
so different owners can safely use the same focused file name later.

## Verification tiers

Use the tier in the file name:

- `test_unit_*.py` exercises rules and contracts in one process.
- `test_integration_*.py` connects SPA components. It can invoke the installed `spa`
  CLI with a controlled fake Aseprite executable, but it does not prove native
  Aseprite behavior.
- `test_e2e_*.py` invokes the installed `spa` CLI with a real Aseprite executable.
  Mark the module or each test with `pytest.mark.e2e`.

Runtime integration fixtures cover incompatible Lua and API observations and structured
failure without claiming native execution. Real-runtime tests execute the packaged
probe and assert its observed embedded Lua version, `app.apiVersion`, JSON round trip,
file I/O, and scripting evidence. These three facilities are prerequisites of a complete
probe response. Runtime capabilities are reported independently: omitting a known
capability does not invalidate the probe, while the Application rejects it before
execution when the selected Descriptor requires it. Each later Operation adds
real-runtime evidence for the native capabilities named by its Descriptor.
The Sprite E2E fixture covers nonempty Frames, Tags, Palettes, nested Layers, Cels,
Slices, and Tilesets in addition to empty-section and unrequested-section semantics.
Slice inspection uses Aseprite's native sprite-sheet metadata export to observe the
complete ordered Key list, converts its zero-based Frames to the public one-based model,
and combines it with public Slice user data. The private metadata and texture remain in
the invocation workspace.
The Export Image E2E fixtures cover native visible Layer composition, RGB Alpha
values, no-profile and sRGB files, unsupported source modes, Tilemap Images on visible
and hidden Layers, unsupported Color Profiles, and explicit replacement. A wheel-installed
test verifies the packaged Export handler and Pillow decoder on Linux CI.
Plan E2E cases cover read-only composition, create/paint/get on one live Sprite,
failed-Step and failed-Postcondition publication gates, and in-place failure
preserving the original file digest. A wheel-installed case verifies the packaged
Plan handler. Static Plan checks execute without Aseprite and report missing Source,
invalid Target parent, and existing Target conflicts. A controlled transport case
verifies one process and typed failed-Step evidence; the real runtime verifies the
shared capability probe before Plan Steps.
Plan preflight also rejects Source aliases that would be replaced by Target Commit and
Postconditions that contradict a first Sprite creation Step. Real Aseprite cases
verify alias rejection with both `in_place` values, same-entry in-place success, and
that a document-dependent Postcondition failure leaves the Target absent.
Aggregate discovery conservatively requires every eligible Plan Step capability;
the Plan execution gate checks selected Step requirements plus mandatory final Sprite
inspection in its one Aseprite process.

The initial evidence profiles use local macOS Aseprite 1.3.18.5-dev and the pinned
Linux CI Aseprite 1.3.18.5 source release. Both expose `_VERSION == "Lua 5.4"` and
`app.apiVersion == 41`; the macOS build's vendored Lua 5.4.6 records source provenance,
not a patch-level compatibility rule. The E2E assertion pins this evidence family while
the runtime compatibility decision continues to use the Descriptor's observed language
and API requirements.

Pytest rejects unregistered markers. The root e2e gate also rejects a selected e2e
test when `SPA_TEST_ASEPRITE` is absent, is not a file, or is not executable. A missing
runtime therefore cannot produce an all-skipped successful e2e run.

Run the fast unit and integration tiers with:

```sh
uv run --frozen --group test pytest -m "not e2e"
```

Run the real-runtime tier with:

```sh
SPA_TEST_ASEPRITE=/path/to/aseprite \
  uv run --frozen --group test pytest -m e2e -rs
```

Use `-rs` so platform and environment skips remain visible. Use collection output when
moving tests to confirm that parametrized cases were preserved:

```sh
uv run --frozen --group test pytest --collect-only -q
```

Run the same source checks used by CI with:

```sh
uv run --frozen ruff check .
uv run --frozen ruff format --check .
uv run --frozen pyright
uv run --frozen python scripts/lua_quality.py
```

`pyright` checks production code under `src/`. Runtime tests deliberately construct
invalid and partially controlled values, so their correctness is enforced by pytest
instead of the production type gate.

The Lua gate covers every tracked `*.lua` file, including production scripts and test
fixtures. Install the Luacheck and StyLua versions pinned in
`.github/actions/setup-lua-quality/action.yml` on your `PATH`. Run only the Lua linter
with `uv run --frozen python scripts/lua_quality.py lint`, or format the Lua baseline
with `uv run --frozen python scripts/lua_quality.py format`. The default command runs
Luacheck and StyLua in check mode. Luacheck checks Lua syntax and known globals;
StyLua checks formatting. Neither check verifies Aseprite API members or native
behavior. Use the real-runtime E2E tier for that evidence.

## CI gates

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request and every push to `main`. The
Release workflow also dispatches it explicitly for the Release PR branch because
GitHub does not emit a second workflow event for a pull request updated with
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. All jobs use Python 3.13, uv 0.11.19, and the committed `uv.lock` with
`--frozen`.

| Job | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Source quality | Ruff lint and formatting, Pyright for production source, and Luacheck plus StyLua for all tracked Lua. |
| Fast tests | Unit and integration tests selected with `-m "not e2e"`. |
| Build and smoke test distributions | One sdist and wheel, valid package metadata, and a successful `spa version` from a wheel-only environment populated from locked runtime dependencies. |
| Linux real Aseprite E2E | The project CLI and a wheel-installed CLI drive the pinned real Aseprite `--batch --script` path. A wheel-only negative case reaches the packaged Sprite creation handler and proves that no Target Commit occurs after rejection; a wheel-only Export case verifies a PNG Artifact. The job records JUnit evidence. |

A failure in any job fails CI. Configure these four named jobs as required checks on
`main` when repository branch protection is enabled.

## Platform and display requirements

Verification tier, host platform, and display capability are separate properties.
Place a platform condition on the smallest test that needs it. A passing macOS test is
macOS evidence; it is not Linux evidence. The macOS bundle and restricted-agent cases
remain macOS-specific. Issue #69 owns Linux CI and Linux real-Aseprite evidence.

Aseprite `--batch` does not start the UI. A test that produces or inspects image files
through that path is not windowed unless it actually needs a display. When a future
test does require a window, declare that precondition at the test boundary and add a
shared display gate only when more than one test needs it. An optional run on a host
without display capability can skip with a visible reason. Display permission denial
must fail. A job that claims graphical coverage must fail when its required windowed
tests do not execute.

The Linux job builds the official source release and verifies the archive against the
version and SHA-256 authority in `.github/actions/setup-linux-aseprite/action.yml`. It
enables scripting with Aseprite's `LAF_BACKEND=none`, checks that both `DISPLAY` and
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` are absent, builds and installs the current wheel in a separate
environment, and then runs the real-runtime tier. The JUnit audit
fails when the report is missing, contains zero tests, or all selected tests were
skipped. The job summary records the tested commit, trigger, executable, Aseprite
version, display state, and exercised path. A macOS-only skip remains visible and does
not invalidate the Linux batch evidence while other E2E tests execute.

The setup action caches only an installed Aseprite tree that passes executable, resource,
version, and minimal `--batch --script` checks. Its key includes the runner OS and
architecture, Aseprite version, source checksum, and setup action content. The first run
for a new key builds from source; later runs restore the executable and data files, rerun
the checks, and skip compilation. A successful `main` run seeds the default-branch cache
that later pull requests can read. A pull-request cache remains scoped to that pull
request. GitHub can remove a cache after seven days without access or earlier under the
repository cache limit, so an occasional rebuild is expected.

The Linux real Aseprite job is also part of release verification. A release workflow
always reruns it at the exact release commit and does not reuse a generally green CI
run. A successful macOS local run remains separate developer evidence; it cannot
replace the Linux release gate. Windowed Aseprite behavior has no CI coverage until a
dedicated display-capable job is added with an execution-count gate.
